# Qt/QMLRestTest
This is a small project for testing out my RestAPI with Qt 5.15.2 and QML

===ONLY SUPPORTS JSON===

Use this small programm to GET POST PATCH or DELETE your favourite data :)
Or look at a sourcecode to learn how to do it.

Keep in mind, I only did this because I needed to learn how to use REST with 
Qt for another project  so use this as a  minimal working example.

Hopefully this helps you in some way :D
